# Intelligent Movie Recommendation Engine (I.M.R.E)


### PROBLEM DEFINITION
As the project title states, we built a Movie Recommendation Engine. With the rise of recommendation engines, the movie recommendation engine has been the first go-to dataset anyone would love to work on and we are no different. With that being said, we wanted to do something different from any normal recommendation engine and that was when we decided we would make the best recommender and bring about recommendations based on multiple features and not just a couple of them.
Building a robust recommendation engine without compromising on quality and the accuracy of predictions was a challenge and we believe we did our best with our project.

### METHODOLOGY
The project consists of various tasks and the main ones being DATA, RECOMMENDATION, ANALYTICS.
